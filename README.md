# Arduino
This is a collection of programs I've written or customized for my Adafruit Circuit Playground Express.

## Editing the perceived name and info of a board
One of the programs I've written for my board turns it into a mouse wiggler, sound maker, and lights display.
I wanted to change the name and manufacturer that it's percieved as when plugged into a computer.
To do this, I nevigated to the boards.txt file and made some small changes to a few lines.
